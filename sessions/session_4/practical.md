## The GATK pipeline of somatic short variant (SNVs and indels) discovery

We will use the targeted sequencing data of paired tumor and normal samples from kidney for this practice. The scripts for this task will takes about 25 mins running time, so we will submit the scripts to Biowulf at the beginning of the session and then walk through the scripts together.

**1\.** First let's create a new folder in your personal data directory, and copy all the sample data to this directory.

<code>cd /data/$USER/<br>
mkdir practical_session_4<br>
cd practical_session_4<br>
cp /data/classes/DCEG_Somatic_Workshop/Practical_session_4/* .</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

**2\.** Next, we will submit two sets of scripts to Biowulf. Use the following commands to submit the scripts for step 1.

<code>cd shfiles<br>
jobid1=$(swarm -t 8 -g 24  --gres=lscratch:24 --job-name step1 --time 1:00:00 scripts_for_step1.swarm)<br>
echo $jobid1</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

<code>swarm</code> is a command to submit a group of command lines to biowulf and those command lines will run as parallel processes. The options <code>-g</code>, <code>-t</code> and <code>--time</code> specify the memory (in GB), threads and running time per process. We request 8CPUs and 24GB of memory for each process. The default running time is 2hrs. We assign a job name using the option <code>--job-name</code>. The option <code>--gres</code> is to allocate a local scratch disk space for each process. <code>lscratch:N</code> will require N GB for the scratch space. The directory of this scratch space can be accessed in the script as <code>/lscratch/$SLURM_JOB_ID/</code>. More information could be found at [https://hpc.nih.gov/apps/swarm.html](https://hpc.nih.gov/apps/swarm.html).

The <code>swarm</code> will return a job ID and it will be saved to <code>$jobid1</code> in this script. We then submit the swarm file for step 2 and let it start only after the completion of all commands in the first job. To set up the dependency, we use the option <code>--dependency=afterany:jobid</code> where the jobid is $jobid1. Step 1 will take about 9 mins.


<code>jobid2=$(swarm -t 8 -g 20 --gres=lscratch:20 --dependency=afterany:$jobid1 --job-name step2 scripts_for_step2.swarm)<br>
echo $jobid2</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

In a few seconds, let's check the job status using <code>sjobs<code>, the second job will sit in a pending state until all the processes in job1 are finished.

---

### Data pre-processing for somatic short variant discovery

While we are waiting for the two jobs, let's examine the script.

<code>vi scripts_for_step1.swarm</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}
```bash
#!/bin/bash
sh Step1_preprocess_variant_discovery.sh GPK7017_2000 ../fastq ../Results
sh Step1_preprocess_variant_discovery.sh GPK4013_0401 ../fastq ../Results
```

The first step for somatic or germline variant discovery is to pre-process the raw sequence data to produce analysis-ready BAM files. As the following figure shows, we start from the raw FASTQ files (or BAM files), align them to the reference genome, and clean up the data to correct for technical biases (e.g. duplicate reads, strand bias, cross-sample contamination, etc).

{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/GATK_data_preprocess.png" max-width="20%" %}

**3\.** In the swarm file, each line corresponds to one sample, and will be submitted as one process in the swarm submission. They are all in the format:
<code>sh ./Step1_preprocess_variant_discovery.sh $SAMPLE $INPUT_DIR $OUTPUT_DIR</code>.
All the fields after the bash file (.sh) are arguments, and they will be passed to the bash (.sh) file. All the arguments in the swarm commands should be processed within the bash file. In this way, we can prepare the 'core' commands as bash files to process samples in batches.

**4\.** Now let's quit the swarm file by typing <code>:q</code> and hitting enter, and open the corresponding bash file.

<code>vi Step1_preprocess_variant_discovery.sh</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

```bash
#!/bin/bash

We first load several modules using <code>module load</code>. Then we specify the reference/source files to be used. Most of the reference files corresponding to a pre-installed application in Biowulf can be found in the folder /fdb/.
Note the way we pass the arguments to the bash file. Arguments passed to a script are processed in the same order in which theyâ€™re sent (in this case, the order in the swarm file). The indexing of the arguments starts at one, and the first argument can be accessed inside the script using $1. Similarly, the second argument can be accessed using $2, and so on. Here we assign the first argument to variable $SAMPLE, and so on.

<!--{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/Step1_1.PNG" %}-->
```bash
GATK_Bundle=/fdb/GATK_resource_bundle/hg38-v0
GENOME=$GATK_Bundle/Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta

SAMPLE=$1
INDIR=$2
DIR=$3
logs=$DIR/logs
read1=$INDIR/${SAMPLE}_R1.fastq.gz
read2=$INDIR/${SAMPLE}_R2.fastq.gz
id=$SAMPLE
lb=$id
sm=$id
```

**5\.** We use the [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) command to trim the adapters, [bwa](https://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml) to perform raw alignment to the reference genome, and [samtools sort](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-sort.html) to sort the files by genomic coordinates. The three commands are connected by 'pipes' <code>|</code> to bypass storage of large intermediate files. The adapter trimming step is optional. The backslash at the end of each line is used to skip the line breaker and the command continues in the next line.

<!--{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/Step1_2.PNG" %}-->
```bash
### Perform adaptor trimming on fastq files ###
fastp -i $read1 -I $read2 \
      --stdout --thread 2 \
      -j ${logs}/fastp-${SAMPLE}.json \
      -h ${logs}/fastp-${SAMPLE}.html \
      2> ${logs}/fastp-${SAMPLE}.log | \
bwa mem -M -t 8 \
      -R "@RG\tID:$id\tPL:ILLUMINA\tLB:$lb\tSM:$sm" \
      $GENOME - 2> ${logs}/bwa-${SAMPLE}.log | \
samtools sort -T /lscratch/$SLURM_JOB_ID/ -m 2G -@ 4 -O BAM \
      -o $DIR/${SAMPLE}_sort.bam  2> ${logs}/samtools-${SAMPLE}.log
```

Let's take a look at the three commands separately:

In the last line of the <code>fastp</code> command lines, '2' is a file descriptor. It redirects(writes) any 'standard error' messages to the log file fastp-${SAMPLE}.log, which will be otherwise output to the screen.
In <code>bwa mem</code> options, <code>-t</code>specifies the number of threads. <code>-R</code> specifies the read header lines. <code>-</code> indicates taking the input from the standard input. In this example, we used the pipes to redirect the standard output of last command (aka, fastp) as the standard input into the next command (bwa). So we use this option to tell the script take the output from command as the input data.
In <code>samtools sort</code> options, <code>-T</code> is the prefix of temporary files. <code>-m</code> and <code>-@</code> specify the memory per thread and the number of threads, respectively. <code>-O</code> specifies the output format.   

**6\.** Now we have a sorted raw alignment BAM file. In the next section of the script, we mark read pairs that are likely to have originated from duplicates of the same DNA fragments uing [picard tools](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). The picard tools package contains multiple commands, and the command lines look like this:
<code>java [java opts] -jar $PICARDJARPATH/picard.jar COMMAND [options] </code>

<!--{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/Step1_3.PNG" %}-->
```bash
### Duplicate marking in coordinate-sorted raw BAM files ###
java -Xmx2g -jar $PICARDJARPATH/picard.jar MarkDuplicates \
     -I $DIR/${SAMPLE}_sort.bam \
    -O /dev/stdout \
    -M marked_dup_metrics.txt 2> ${logs}/markdup-${SAMPLE}.log \
| java -Xmx2g -jar $PICARDJARPATH/picard.jar SortSam \
      -I /dev/stdin -O $DIR/${SAMPLE}_markdup_sorted.bam \
      -SORT_ORDER coordinate 2>> ${logs}/markdup-${SAMPLE}.log
```

We use a pipe to connect two picard commands <code>MarkDuplicates</code> and <code>SortSam</code>. Similar to the bwa example, in the second picard command, we use <code>-I /dev/stdin</code> to specify reading from standard input.

**7\.** In the last part of the script, we recalibrate base quality score to correct for patterns of systematic errors using the [GATK tools for BQSR](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035890531-Base-Quality-Score-Recalibration-BQSR-). The GATK command lines look like this:
<code>gatk --java-options "[java opts]" ToolName [options] </code>

<!--{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/Step1_4.PNG" %}-->
```bash
### Recaliberating base quality score###
gatk --java-options "-Djava.io.tmpdir=/lscratch/$SLURM_JOBID -Xms6G -Xmx6G -XX:ParallelGCThreads=2" BaseRecalibrator \
  -I $DIR/${SAMPLE}_markdup_sorted.bam \
  -R $GENOME \
  -O  $DIR/${SAMPLE}_markdup_bqsr.report \
  --known-sites $DBSNP \
  --known-sites $INDEL \
  --known-sites $GOLD_INDEL \
  > ${logs}/BQSR-${SAMPLE}.log 2>&1

gatk --java-options "-Djava.io.tmpdir=/lscratch/$SLURM_JOBID -Xms6G -Xmx6G -XX:ParallelGCThreads=2" ApplyBQSR \
  -I $DIR/${SAMPLE}_markdup_sorted.bam  \
  -R $GENOME \
  --bqsr-recal-file  $DIR/${SAMPLE}_markdup_bqsr.report \
  -O  $DIR/${SAMPLE}_markdup_bqsr.bam \
  >> ${logs}/BQSR-${SAMPLE}.log 2>&1
```

The first tool <code>BaseRecalibrator</code> builds the recalibration model. As we calculate the mismatched bases, we exclude the loci known to vary in the population, which requires the input of known variants resource. And this is specified by the option <code>--known-sites</code>.  The second tool, <code>ApplyBQSR</code> ,adjusts the score based on the model.

The command line <code>> ${logs}/BQSR-${SAMPLE}.log 2>&1</code> redirects 'standard error' messages - denoted by file descriptor '2' - to the 'standard output' - denoted by file descriptor '1', and writes both mesagges to the log file BQSR-${SAMPLE}.log, which will be otherwise output to the screen.

**8\.** By the end of step 1, you should have generated analysis-ready BAM files for each individual sample (tumor and normal). We prepared the sample output data in the /Results/ directory for you to check.

<code>ls ../Results</code>

---

### Somatic short variant discovery using MuTect2

Next we will use the analysis-ready BAM files to proceed the GATK pipeline for somatic short variant discovery. There are two main steps: generating candidate variants and filtering. We use GATK tools for both steps. For more details please refer to: [https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035894731-Somatic-short-variant-discovery-SNVs-Indels-](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035894731-Somatic-short-variant-discovery-SNVs-Indels-).

{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/GATK_somatic_variant_calling.png" %}

Let's examine the swarm file.
<code>vi scripts_for_step2.swarm</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}
```bash
#!/bin/bash
sh Step2_somatic_variant_discovery_MuTect2.sh  GPK7017_2000 GPK4013_0401 PAP1_1708_01_T01 ../Results ../Results
```

Simlar to the first step, we use one bash file to process tumor/normal sample pairs in batches. In this example, we have only one tumor/normal pair, but we can easily scale up in this way. Now let's quit the swarm file by with <code>:q</code> and open the script file:

<code>vi Step2_somatic_variant_discovery_MuTect2.sh</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

```bash
#!/bin/bash

```

**9\.** In the first part, we load necessary modules, specify reference resources and arguments from input. We pass five arguments from the swarm commands in the following order: normal sample name, tumor sample name, prefix for output file name (e.g. patient or subject ID), input file directory, and output file directory.

<!--{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/Step2_1.PNG" %}-->
```bash
GATK_Bundle=/fdb/GATK_resource_bundle/hg38-v0
GENOME=$GATK_Bundle/Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta
COMMONVAR=/data/classes/DCEG_Somatic_Workshop/Practical_session_4/Reference/small_exac_common_3.hg38.vcf.gz

NSAMPLE=$1
TSAMPLE=$2
PREFIX=$3
INDIR=$4
DIR=$5
logs=$DIR/logs
```

**10\.** In the next part, we use the GATK tool [Mutect2](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037593851-Mutect2) to call candidate variants.

<!--{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/Step2_2.PNG" %}-->

```bash
### SNV and Indel calling  ###
gatk --java-options "-Djava.io.tmpdir=/lscratch/$SLURM_JOBID -Xms20G -Xmx20G -XX:ParallelGCThreads=1" Mutect2 \
  -R $GENOME \
  -I $BAM_NORMAL \
  -I $BAM_TUMOR \
  -normal $BASE_NORMAL \
  -tumor $BASE_TUMOR \
  -O $OUT_VCF \
  > ${logs}/Mutect2-${PREFIX}.log 2>&1
```

The options <code>-I</code> were used twice to specify the input BAM files for normal and tumor samples, respectively. The names of the tumor and normal samples are specified by the options <code>-tumor</code> and <code>-normal</code>, which have to match the sample names in the read group lines of the BAM file. Note that the read group lines take this format: <code>@RG\tID:$id\tPL:ILLUMINA\tLB:$lb\tSM:$sm</code>, and the sample names are in the last field.

If we are working with whole exome or genome sequencing data, then this step requires a large amount of memory. They can be changed in the java options <code>-Xms</code> and <code>-Xmx</code>. MuTect2 does not allow multithreading in its options. So to spped up this process, you may consider parallel computing using a 'scatter-gather' approach, that is, run separate GATK commands to process a proportion of the input data and collate all the results into the final output. For more information, please refer to [https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035532012-Parallelism-Multithreading-Scatter-Gather](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035532012-Parallelism-Multithreading-Scatter-Gather).


**11\.** The next part of the script calculates the cross-sample contamination and estimates the allelic copy number segmentation for each tumor sample. It will generate a contamination-table file that will be used for filtering  This is an optional step.

<!--{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/Step2_3.PNG" %}-->
```bash
### Filtering the MuTect2 variant calls ###
### Estimate cross-sample contamination  ###

gatk --java-options "-Xms10G -Xmx10G -XX:ParallelGCThreads=2" GetPileupSummaries \
   -I $BAM_TUMOR \
   -V $COMMONVAR \
   -L $COMMONVAR \
   -O $DIR/${TSAMPLE}_pileups.table \
   > ${logs}/VarFilter-${PREFIX}.log 2>&1

gatk --java-options "-Xms10G -Xmx10G -XX:ParallelGCThreads=2" GetPileupSummaries \
   -I $BAM_NORMAL \
   -V $COMMONVAR \
   -L $COMMONVAR \
   -O $DIR/${NSAMPLE}_pileups.table \
   >> ${logs}/VarFilter-${PREFIX}.log 2>&1

gatk --java-options "-Xms10G -Xmx10G -XX:ParallelGCThreads=2" CalculateContamination \
     -I $DIR/${TSAMPLE}_pileups.table \
     -matched $DIR/${NSAMPLE}_pileups.table \
     -tumor-segmentation $DIR/${TSAMPLE}_segments.table \
     -O $DIR/${TSAMPLE}_calculatecontamination.table \
     >> ${logs}/VarFilter-${PREFIX}.log 2>&1
```

The tool <code>GetPileupSummaries</code> summarizes read counts that support reference, alternative and other alleles for given sites. In its options <code>-V</code> and <code>-L</code>, it requires an input file for common germline variant sites, e.g. this file from the gnomAD resource. We provide a reference file small_exac_common_3.hg38.vcf.gz in our folder. Other reference files for this purpose (e.g. gnomAD) can be found at the GATK Google bucket. In an interactive session, you may use the following commands to check and download the reference files for common germline variant sites.

<code>module load google-cloud-sdk<br>
gsutil ls gs://gatk-best-practices/somatic-hg38/<br>
gsutil ls gs://gatk-best-practices/somatic-hg38/af-only-gnomad.hg38.vcf.gz* ./</code>

**12\.** Then we will filter the mutation candidates using the tool [FilterMutationCalls](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360036856831-FilterMutectCalls). The options <code>--contamination-table</code> and <code>--tumor-segmentation</code> use the output from the previous step and are optional.

<!--{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/Step2_4.PNG" %}-->
```bash
### Filter variants  ###

gatk --java-options "-Djava.io.tmpdir=/lscratch/$SLURM_JOBID -Xms20G -Xmx20G -XX:ParallelGCThreads=2" FilterMutectCalls \

  --contamination-table $DIR/${TSAMPLE}_calculatecontamination.table \
  --stats $OUT_STATS \
  --tumor-segmentation $DIR/${TSAMPLE}_segments.table \

  >> ${logs}/VarFilter-${PREFIX}.log 2>&1
awk '($1 ~/^#/) || ($7 ~ /PASS/) {print}' $OUT_FILTERED_VCF >$OUT_PASSED_VCF
```

This process annotates the variants as 'PASS' in the 'FILTER' field in its output VCF file, but will keep all the candidate variants, including those that failed the filtering, in its output. So we use an <code>awk</code> command to extract all the variants that pass the filtering.

**13\.** At the end of step 2, we have VCF files for original candidates and candidates that pass the filtering. How do we check the number of candidate mutations in each file? We use these commands.

<code>grep -v "^#" PAP1_1708_01_T01.vcf | wc -l<br>
grep -v "^#" PAP1_1708_01_T01_passed.vcf | wc -l </code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

<code>grep -v</code> will extract all lines that do NOT contain a specific pattern. The pattern we specify is "^#", which is lines starting with the "#" symbol. This will exclude all the header lines in the VCF file. Then we redirect the output to the command <code>wc -l</code> which calculates the number of lines.

### Annotation of somatic short variants

Now we have a list of variants ready for the downstream analysis. To prioritize the variants for downstream analysis. we will functionally annotate these variants. There are multiple applications for this analysis, and we are going to show two methods, [Funcotator](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035889931-Funcotator-Information-and-Tutorial) and [ANNOVAR](https://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/).

**14\.** We first annotate with Funcotator. Confirm that you are in the interactive session, and enter the following commands.

<code>cd /data/$USER/practical_session_4/shfiles<br>
sh ./Step3_funcotator_annotation.sh  PAP1_1708_01_T01 ../Expected_Results ../Results</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

The script will take a few seconds. Let's first check the bash scripts.

<code>vi /data/classes/DCEG_Somatic_Workshop/Practical_session_4/shfiles/Step3_funcotator_annotation.sh</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

<!--{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/Step3_1.PNG" %}-->

duration=$SECONDS
echo "Annotation completed. $(($duration / 60)) minutes and $(($duration % 60)) seconds elapsed."
```

Funcotator is a tool in the GATK package. It requires five input files:
<code>-R</code> A reference genome sequence.
<code>-V</code> A VCF of variant calls to annotate.
<code>--data-sources-path</code> The path to data sources or required formats.
<code>--ref_version</code> The version of the reference genome sequence being used.
<code>--output-file-format</code> The desired output format for the annotated variants file (MAF or VCF).
We also specify the output file name with the <code>-O</code> option.

```bash
gatk --java-options "-Xms10G -Xmx10G -XX:ParallelGCThreads=2" Funcotator -R $GENOME \
     -V $IN_VCF \
     -O $OUT_ANNOT_MAF \
     --output-file-format MAF \
     --data-sources-path $FUNCOTATORDB \
     --ref-version hg38
```

All the data source files have already been downloaded in the Biowulf, so we specify the data source folder using this command: <code>FUNCOTATORDB=/fdb/GATK_resource_bundle/funcotator/funcotator_dataSources.v1.7.20200521s</code>
The script takes three arguments to generate the input/output paths and file names: the prefix of the input VCF file, the input and output directories.
The basic output files in VCF or MAF format contains all variants from the input file, with added annotation from the data sources.

We will run the second annotation package ANNOVAR and check the results together later.

**15\.** Next we annotate with ANNOVAR. The command lines are very similar:

<code>cd /data/$USER/practical_session_4/shfiles<br>
sh ./Step3_annovar_annotation.sh  PAP1_1708_01_T01 ../Expected_Results ../Results</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

Next let's check the bash scripts.

<code>vi /data/classes/DCEG_Somatic_Workshop/Practical_session_4/shfiles/Step3_annovarannotation.sh</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

<!--{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/Step3_2.PNG" %}-->

	-nastring . -csvout -polish

duration=$SECONDS
echo "Annotation completed. $(($duration / 60)) minutes and $(($duration % 60)) seconds elapsed."
```

The program <code>convert2annovar.pl</code> converts the VCF format into the ANNOVAR input format (.avinput file). For specification of the ANNOVAR input format, you may get more details at: [https://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/user-guide/input/](https://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/user-guide/input/).

```bash
convert2annovar.pl -format vcf4 $IN_VCF -includeinfo >${PREFIX}.avinput
table_annovar.pl  ${PREFIX}.avinput $ANNOVAR_DATA/hg38 \
	-buildver hg38 -out ${PREFIX} -remove \
	-protocol refGene,cytoBand,exac03,avsnp147,dbnsfp30a -operation g,r,f,f,f \
	-nastring . -csvout -polish
```

The program <code>table_annovar.pl</code> is the core command for annotation. <code>-protocol</code> specifies the annotation sources to use:ExAC version 0.3 (referred as exac03), dbNFSP version 3.0a (referred to as dbnsfp30a), dbSNP version 147 with left-normalization (referred to as avsnp147). Each 'protocol' corresponds to one field in the <code>-option</code> argument: gene-based (referred to as g), gene-based with cross-reference annotation (referred to as gx), region-based (referred to as r) and filter-based (referred to as f). In the final output file, a tab-delimited file with many columns will contain the input columns and annotation columns, that correspond to the  combination of 'protocol' and 'option'. For more details, please refer to [https://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/user-guide/startup/#table_annovarpl](https://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/user-guide/startup/#table_annovarpl).

**16\.** Now open the two output files for both software in Excel.

<code>PAP1_1708_01_T01_funcotator.maf<br>
PAP1_1708_01_T01.hg38_multianno.csv</code>

The Funcotator output is in the MAF format, the first several columns are the basic features of the mutation: genomic coordinates, reference and variant alleles, variant classifications and types. The variant classifications and types could be used to prioritize candidate driver mutations.

{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/Funcotator_1.PNG" %}

If we scroll to the right, there are annotations of genomic, cDNA and protein  changes.

{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/Funcotator_2.PNG" %}

The ANNOVAR output is in VCF format. The first several columns include basic information about the variants. The columns of 'Func.refGene' and 'ExonicFunc.refGene' could be used to prioritize candidate driver mutations. The column 'AAChange.refGene' provides similar information to the protein changes annotated by Funcotator.

{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/ANNOVAR_1.PNG" %}

For the next a few columns, the ExAC* columns are allele frequencies in all the samples and the subpopulations in the Exome Aggregation Consortium data sets. The column 'avsnp147' is the SNP ID in the dbSNP database. The other columns are prediction scores for the likelihood of non-synonymous variants to be deleterious using several popular tools, such as SIFT, PolyPhen2, HDIV,  LRT, and so on.

## Examining variants in IGV

**17\.** Locate IGV on your computer and double click it to launch the application.

**18\.** In the upper left of the IGV window you will see a dropdown menu to select a reference genome. Select  GRCh38/hg38.

**19\.** Now you will need to load the BAM files into IGV. These files can be downloaded from . You can download them like so (replace USERNAME with your unique Biowulf username):

<code>scp -r USERNAME@helix.nih.gov:/scratch/sangj2/0-Session4-IGV .</code>

Once the files are downloaded, load them into IGV by clicking **File >> Load from File...**, locating your downloaded files, and selecting Normal.bam and Tumor.bam.

{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/IGV-load.png" max-width="60%" %}

**20\.** You should see the loaded file names Normal.bam and Tumor.bam on the left side of the IGV window, which in IGV are referred to as 'tracks'. In addition, you might also see "Normal.bam Junctions" and "Tumor.bam Junctions". If you do, you can remove them by right clicking on these tracks and on the menu that appears click "Remove Track". These junction tracks are not useful for today's demonstration and will use extra computer memory, causing IGV to slow down.

{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/IGV-removeJunctions.png" max-width="60%" %}

---

### Passing Variants

**21\.** Now let's examine some variants. First, search 'chr7:116782048 in the search bar at the top of the IGV window (boxed in red in the example image below). Individually right click "Normal.bam" and "Tumor.bam" and select **Color alignments by >> read strand** in the menu that appears for each; this will allow you to clearly see which reads are forward-strand reads and which are reverse-strand reads.

{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/IGV-exonPASS.png" max-width="60%" %}

This variant is within an exon of the MET gene, and passes variant filters (FILTER column="PASS" in the .vcf file).

Likewise we can examine a passing intronic variant. In the search bar at the top, search for 'chr7:2980922' and hit Go.

{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/IGV-intronPASS.png" max-width="60%" %}

---

### Filtered Variants

**22\.** Let's now examine some variants that do not pass filters. In the search bar at the top, search for 'chr7:65975357'. This variant was filtered because it was flagged as germline, and you can see that both the tumor and normal samples contain a roughly equal proportion of reads with a C>G variant.

{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/IGV-germlineEvent.png" max-width="60%" %}

To see a variant exhibiting strand bias, search for 'chr7:99966779' in the search bar. As you can see, these variants are only detected on reverse-strand reads and not forward-strand reads, which is a likely sign of an artifact from sequencing.

{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/IGV-strandBias.png" max-width="60%" %}

Lastly, we highlight a multi-allelic site. Search for 'chr7:140777206'. Here you can see at that genomic location the reference is an A, the tumor contains many A>T mutations, but also has several reads with a deletion at that location. Multi-allelic sites are generally very rare and are more likely to be a sign of a noisy region in the genome than a true variant.

{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/IGV-multiAllele.png" max-width="60%" %}

## Introduction to Maftools

Maftools is an R package designed to summarize, analyze, annotate, and visualize [Mutation Annotation Format (MAF)](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data/File_Formats/MAF_Format/) files. Today, we will be using the maftools package to analyze and visualize the data within a MAF file.

The package consists of visualization and analysis based modules. The diagram below provides a visual representation of these modules as well as the inputs needed to run them.

{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/maftools_summary.png" max-width="75%" %}

<figcaption class="is-italic is-size-7" style="align: center">
<a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/maftools/inst/doc/maftools.html#5_Overview_of_the_package">Image from the Maftools documents</a>
</figcaption>

For a more in-depth explanation of maftools, how to use it, and its capabilities beyond our
demonstration today, use this [link](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/maftools/inst/doc/maftools.html).

---

### Download session directory

First we will download the directory we have created for this session. This directory is called <code>session4_maftools</code>, and you can download it [here]().

This directory includes 2 files: 1) the MAF data we will be using today, and 2) the R script with all of the commands you will find throughout this part of the practical session.

For consistency, **move this downloaded directory to your Documents folder.**

**Go to the session4_maftools folder and open the file, maf_session4_practice_FINAL.R.**

---

### Install and load maftools package in R

If you havenâ€™t done so already, you will need to install the maftools package in R.  Use the following commands to do this:

{% include code-block-copy.html %}
```R
# install BiocManager if not already installed
if (!require("BiocManager"))
  install.packages("BiocManager")
# install maftools if not already installed
BiocManager::install("maftools")
```

The code above installs BiocManager if it is not already installed, and then uses BiocManager to install the maftools package.  BiocManager is a package manager for the Bioconductor repository, which includes a series of R packages used for genomic analysis. Click these links for additional information about [BiocManager](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BiocManager/vignettes/BiocManager.html) or [Bioconductor](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BiocManager/vignettes/BiocManager.html).

After you install maftools, load the package using the command:
<code style="color: blue">library(maftools)</code>

**Additional Information:** For some functions in exercises not being demonstrated today but available as supplemental information, you will need to use the tidyverse package. Install the tidyverse package if you do not already have it installed. Then load tidyverse. This package contains a group of R packages that are useful for data analyses and visualization.

{% include code-block-copy.html %}
```R
if(!('tidyverse' %in% installed.packages())){
  install.packages('tidyverse')
  library(tidyverse)
}else{
  library(tidyverse)
}
```

---

### Load the data into R

Run <code style="color: blue">getwd()</code> to make sure that the current working directory is the path to the session4_maftools folder:

```R
>getwd()

Mac:
[1] "/Users/[username]/Documents/session4_maftools"
Windows:
[1] "C:/Users/[username]/Documents/session4_maftools"
```

If the working directory is not the session4_maftools directory, use the <code>setwd()</code> command to set this directory as the working directory (replace [username] with your NIH username):

**Mac:** <code style="color: blue">setwd("/Users/[username]/Documents/session4_maftools")</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}
**Windows:** <code style="color: blue">setwd("C:/Users/[username]/Documents/session4_maftools")</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

Then run <code style="color: blue">getwd()</code> as before to make sure the working directory is now correct.

We have extracted over 550 TCGA-LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma) whole exome sequencing (WES) samples using the public MAF file generated as a part of the TCGA MC3 project. A sample manifest file was used to extract data for primary tumor WES samples from the public MAF file.

To load the MAF file, we will need to use the path to the file so it can be loaded into R. Use the command below to load the data file:

<code style="color: blue">tcga_luad_maf <- read.maf(maf='tcga_luad_maf_final.gz')</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

You will see the following appear as the file is read, validated, and summarized:
```R
-Reading
|--------------------------------------------------|
|==================================================|
-Validating
--Removed 17797 duplicated variants
-Silent variants: 70411

-Processing clinical data
--Missing clinical data
-Finished in 14.2s elapsed (12.8s cpu)
```

### Summarize the mutation data

For a quick summary of the maf object you have generated from the data loaded, simply type the object name. You will see a summary of the object.

<code style="color: blue">tcga_luad_maf</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

```R
An object of class MAF
                        ID summary    Mean Median
 1:             NCBI_Build  GRCh37      NA     NA
 2:                 Center       .      NA     NA

14:                  total  156140 275.379    187
```

The summary of the object above shows you the genome build used in generating this data, the number of samples included, the number of genes included, and a variety of variant classification types, ranging from frame shifts to nonstop mutations.

**Additional Information:** We are not going to go through the following commands today, but you can use them to generate a sample summary, a gene summary, explore the fields in the file (i.e. column names), and even write a MAF summary.

<details>

<summary> More Details </summary>

<blockquote>

To generate a summary of the MAF file by sample: <code style="color: blue">getSampleSummary(tcga_luad_maf) %>% View()</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %} .

Here is an example of what the first few rows and columns of that table look like:

{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/maftools_getSampleSummary.png" max-width="70%"%}

To generate a summary of the MAF file by gene: <code style="color: blue">getGeneSummary(tcga_luad_maf) %>% View()</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %} .

Here is an example of what the first few rows and columns of that table look like:

{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/maftools_getGeneSummary.png" max-width="70%"%}

<b>Tip:</b> Using View() after these commands opens them in a new tab in RStudio in an interactive table format. Otherwise the table will print directly to the R console in a format that is difficult to read.

<code style="color: blue">getFields(tcga_luad_maf)</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}
This will print fields included in the MAF object. There are 114 fields in our object, so shown here are just the first 10.

[1] "Hugo_Symbol"                   "Entrez_Gene_Id"               
[3] "Center"                        "NCBI_Build"                   
[5] "Chromosome"                    "Start_Position"

<code style="color: blue">write.mafSummary(maf=tcga_luad_maf, basename='tcga_luad')</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}
This will save a MAF summary to your current working directory. This consists of several files, including clinicalData (if available), maftools.MAF, summary, sampleSummary, and geneSummary files. Here is an example of these files on a local machine after they have been generated:

## Visualization and analysis with Maftools

We are going to be running several analyses and generating several visualizations of the MAF data that you have successfully loaded into R.

### plotmafSummary()

We will start with generating a plot of the MAF summary. This summary of the data includes variant classification, variant type, SNV class, variants per sample, a variant classification summary, and the top 10 mutated genes.

Use the following command to generate the MAF summary for the TCGA-LUAD data:

<code style="color: blue">plotmafSummary(maf = tcga_luad_maf, rmOutlier = TRUE, addStat = 'median', dashboard = TRUE, titvRaw = FALSE)</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/maftools_plotMafSummary.png" %}

**Note:** Additional parameters in this command include the following:

- <code style="color: blue">rmOutlier</code>, which removes outliers from the boxplot if TRUE
- <code style="color: blue">addStat</code>, adds median or mean to Variant per sample plot when set, otherwise set to NULL
- <code style="color: blue">dashboard</code>, plot dashboard instead of simple summary when TRUE
- <code style="color: blue">titvRaw</code>, plots raw variant counts when FALSE or fractions when TRUE

**Tip:** For help as to how a function works or what additional arguments there are, you can use <code style="color: blue">?{function_name}()</code>. For example, <code style="color: blue">?plotmafSummary</code> would provide information about this plotting function.

Below is a brief explanation for each of the components in the summary above

### oncoplot()

Now we will generate two different oncoplots for several different genes included in the MAF file. Oncoplots can help to visualize the mutational landscape of samples in a study or cohort.

First, we will generate an oncoplot for the top 10 most mutated genes in the TCGA-LUAD samples. Use the following command:

<code style="color: blue">oncoplot(maf = tcga_luad_maf, top = 10)</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/maftools_oncoplotTop10.png" %}

The oncoplot shows the tumor mutational burden in each sample (top panel), the number of samples with a mutation in the given gene (right panel), and the variant classifications in each sample per gene (main panel). Each row is a gene and each column is a sample.

In the title of the plot, we can see that almost 90% of these samples have mutations in at least one of these top 10 genes. TP53 is mutated in the largest percentage of samples, 51%. We can also see that missense mutations are the dominant variant classification across these genes in the TCGA-LUAD samples.

We can also generate an oncoplot for specific genes. See the example below where we plot only TP53, KRAS, and EGFR.

<code style="color: blue">oncoplot(maf = tcga_luad_maf, genes = c('TP53','KRAS','EGFR'))</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

{% include image-modal.html link="practical_assets/maftools_oncoplotGenes.png" %}

We see the TP53 and KRAS are similar to the first oncoplot, but it is evident that the samples along the x-axis are in a different order, due to the difference seen in the KRAS plot in the first plot versus the second plot. This plot has a new addition, EGFR, which contains a number of in-frame deletions in addition to the common missense mutation we have seen thus far.

---

### lollipopPlot()

Next we will create a lollipop plot, which will help to visualize amino acid changes in the samples. For this plot, the longest transcript is selected for plotting by default, and a series of lollipops are plotted to denote amino acid changes, and are colored by variant classification.

First, we will generate a plot for TP53, labeling a few specific amino acid positions:

<code style="color: blue">lollipopPlot(maf=tcga_luad_maf, gene= 'TP53', AACol = 'HGVSp_Short', showMutationRate = TRUE, labelPos=c(175,245,273))</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

{% include image-modal.html %}

In the plot above, we see the different protein domains of p53 along the amino acid residue positions on the x-axis. In the main panel of the plot, there is a lollipop for each of the amino acid positions that have a mutation. These lollipops are colored by variant classification (legend bottom left), and we have added a label to a few of the lollipops by using the argument <code style="color: blue">labelPos</code> which follows the notation Original Residue-Amino Acid Position- NewResidue/Residues. In this plot for TP53, we can see that the mutation rate across the TCGA-LUAD samples is about 51%. There are several mutations, with changes at residue 175, 245, and 273 labeled.

We can also generate a plot where we label all of the amino acid changes. We will use KRAS for this example, since it does not have nearly as many lollipops as TP53:

<code style="color: blue">lollipopPlot(maf = tcga_luad_maf, gene = 'KRAS', AACol = 'HGVSp_Short', showMutationRate = TRUE, labelPos = 'all')</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

{% include image-modal.html %}

In the plot above, we see the different protein domains of KRAS along the amino acid residue positions. In the main panel of the plot, there is a lollipop for each of the amino acid positions that have a mutation. These lollipops are colored by variant classification (legend bottom left), and this time we have set <span style="color: blue">labelPos='all'</span> since the plot has fewer lollipops that they could all be seen clearly. In this plot for KRAS, we can see that the mutation rate across the TCGA-LUAD samples is about 30%. There are several mutations at the G12 position, the first set of lollipops you see on the far left of the plot.

**Tip:** If your KRAS plot is a bit cluttered along the protein domains, stretch the plot window in R or click â€˜Zoomâ€™ and then make the window larger.

### rainfallPlot()

Now we will generate a rainfall plot, which helps to illustrate hyper-mutated genomic regions by plotting the inter variant distance on a linear genomic scale. These sort of localized hypermutations can be found in cancer genomes.

We will be using data from TCGA breast cancer samples that include a few examples of this phenomenon.

First, we need to direct R to where this file is stored, using the <code style="color: blue">system.file()</code> function. We are pointing R to the <code style="color: blue">extdata</code> folder in the maftools package, where the file, brca.maf.gz, is located:

<code style="color: blue">brca <- system.file("extdata", "brca.maf.gz", package = "maftools")</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

Now, we use the read.maf() function as we did before to read in the TCGA-LUAD data:

<code style="color: blue">brca <- read.maf(maf = brca, verbose = FALSE)</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

Use this data to generate the rainfall plot. By default, the plot is generated for the most mutated sample, but a sample name can be provided if desired by using the tsb argument.

<code style="color: blue">rainfallPlot(maf=brca, pointSize = 0.4, detectChangePoints = TRUE)</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

You will see the following appear in the console as the plot is generated:
```R

6: 4081         TCGA-A8-A08B   4   4
```

This is because we included the <span style="color: blue">detectChangePoints = TRUE</span> argument. When set to <span style="color: blue">TRUE</span>, this detects genomic change points where potential kataegis are formed. Kataegis are genomic segments where there are six or more consecutive mutations with an average inter-mutation distance of less than or equal to 1,000 bp. The results printed to the console are also automatically saved to a tab-delimited file in your current working directory. In this case, the tsv file saved is named: TCGA-A8-A08B_Kataegis.tsv.

In the plot below generated using the breast cancer data, arrows denote the areas of kataegis. You can see in these areas there are several mutations very close to one another.

{% include image-modal.html %}

**Additional Information:** We can try to find some of these events in the TCGA-LUAD samples as well. First, we will find the tumor mutational burden (TMB), the total number of mutations (changes) found in the DNA of cancer cells. Then we take those with the highest levels of TMB and see if we can identify any katageis events.

a. Calculate TMB and arrange by descending total TMB, then pull the top 10 tumor sample barcodes:

This first command runs the <span style="color: blue">tmb()</span> function available in maftools:

<code style="color: blue">tmb_tcga_luad <- tmb(tcga_luad_maf, logScale = TRUE)</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

After running this first command, you will see a Mutation Burden plot pop-up in the Plots window. This shows you the mutation burden across (TMB/MB(log10)) samples. There is a median 3.74/MB mutations per sample. In addition, if you type <span style="color: blue">tmb_tcga_luad</span> in the console, you will see that there is a table that has been generated with TMB information.

{% include image-modal.html %}

This command takes the table generated in step one and arranges it so samples with higher numbers of mutations are first in the table rather than last:

<code style="color: blue">tmb_tcga_luad <- tmb_tcga_luad %>% arrange(desc(total))</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

This command pulls only the first ten tumor sample barcodes and saves them to a tsb variable:

<code style="color: blue">tsb <- tmb_tcga_luad$Tumor_Sample_Barcode[1:10]</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

b. Run the <span style="color: blue">rainfallPlot()</span> function for each tumor sample barcode to see if there are any events. **Hint: To save you some time, you will observe one kataegis event for the fourth tumor sample barcode in the top 10:**

<code style="color: blue">rainfallPlot(maf=tcga_luad_maf, pointSize = 0.4, detectChangePoints = TRUE, tsb= tsb[4])</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

```R
Processing TCGA-78-7155-01A-11D-2036-08..
Kataegis detected at:
   Chromosome Start_Position End_Position nMuts Avg_intermutation_dist
 1:         11       67925397     67926536     7               189.8333

 ```

 {% include image-modal.html %}

 We can see from the table that the event is on chromosome 11 and consists of 7 mutations. In the plot, we see where the start of the event is as denoted by the arrow.

---

### tcgaCompare()

We can compare mutation load between our samples and 33 TCGA cohorts that are built into the maftools package from the TCGA MC3 project.

First, we want to make our outer plot margins a little bigger so that our plot isnâ€™t cut off:

<code style="color: blue">par(oma=c(2,5,2,2))</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

Now we can run the following <span style="color: blue">tcgaCompare()</span> command to generate a plot:

<code style="color: blue">tcga_luad_mutload <- tcgaCompare(maf = tcga_luad_maf, cohortName = 'Example Data', logscale = TRUE, capture_size = 35.8)</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

{% include image-modal.html %}

We set the <span style="color: blue">capture_size</span> parameter to 35.8 mb because this was the capture size used in the capture kit for TCGA samples.

Along the top of the plot are the case counts for each cancer type. Cancer types are along the bottom of the plot, and TMB (per MB) is on the y-axis. The red line across each cancer type is the median TMB. We can see that our group of TCGA-LUAD samples has one of the higher TMB values.

You may have noticed we are using TCGA-LUAD data, while also comparing to the LUAD cohort. The number of cases differs between these, with 566 in our dataset, and only 516 in the cohort in the maftools package. This is most likely due to a version freeze of the data included in the maftools package.

Before moving on, we need to reset our plot parameters, using the command:

<code style="color: blue">dev.off()</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

---

### somaticInteractions()

We can use the <span style="color: blue">somaticInteractions()</span> function to detect mutually exclusive or co-occurring sets of genes. This function performs a pair-wise Fisherâ€™s Exact test to detect these significant interactions.  This plot can be based on the top X genes in your dataset, or we can select specific genes to display.

So that the plot text and labels are not cut off in the output plot, we are going to adjust the left and top outer margins:

<code style="color: blue">par(oma=c(0,1,0.5,0))</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

First, we will look at the top 10 genes in the TCGA-LUAD data, using the following command:

<code style="color: blue">somaticInteractions(maf = tcga_luad_maf, top = 10, pvalue = c(0.05,0.1),nShiftSymbols = 2)</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

You will see that in addition to a plot appearing in the plot window, there is a table generated to highlight all of the mutually exclusive and co-occurrence events. This table is ordered by p-value significance.

{% include image-modal.html %}

In this plot, we can see a mutually exclusive significant interaction between KRAS and TP53, noted by the larger -log10(P-value) and the * symbol, denoting a P-value < 0.05. We can also see several significant co-occurrence interactions between TP53 and all of the other genes found in this plot.

**Note:** Here we have changed the <span style="color: blue">nShiftSymbols</span> parameter to 2 from a default value of 5, so that the P-value symbol legend does not overlap with the plot.

Now we will note the specific genes we would like to see in the plot:

<code style="color: blue">somaticInteractions(maf = tcga_luad_maf, genes = c('KRAS','EGFR','ERBB4','NTRK3','NF1','PDGFRA','BRAF','ALK','ROS1','NRTK2'), pvalue = c(0.05,0.1), nShiftSymbols = 2)</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

{% include image-modal.html %}

In this plot, we can see a mutually exclusive significant interaction between *KRAS* and *BRAF*, *KRAS* and *NF1*, and *KRAS* and *EGFR*, noted by the larger -log10(P-value) and the * symbol, denoting a P-value < 0.05. We can also see several significant co-occurrence interactions, such as between *ERBB4* and *ALK*.

**Note:** Similar to the first <span style="color: blue">somaticInteractions()</span> plot, the <span style="color: blue">nShiftSymbols</span> parameter was changed to 2 from a default value of 5, so that the P-value symbol legend does not overlap with the plot.

Like before, we will reset the plot parameters back to the default by using the following command:

<code style="color: blue">dev.off()</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

You can use the oncoplot to double check the relationship between two genes. For example, only one sample carries both KRAS and EGFR mutations in the TCGA-LUAD cohort, validating the mutually exclusive event. This can be visualized with the following code:

<code style="color: blue">oncoplot(maf = tcga_luad_maf, genes = c('KRAS','EGFR'))</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

{% include image-modal.html %}

---

### OncogenicPathways() and PlotOncogenicPathways()

We can also use the <span style="color: blue">OncogenicPathways()</span> function to look for enrichment of known Oncogenic Signaling Pathways. This function generates a plot as well as a table (which is output to the console).  Use the following command to generate both:

<code style="color: blue">OncogenicPathways(maf = tcga_luad_maf)</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

Here is what that output table looks like:

{% include image-modal.html %}

Here you see the name of the pathway (e.g., TP53 pathway), the number of genes included in the pathway, the total number of genes in the pathway affected at least in one sample, the fraction of the pathway affected, the total number of samples with mutations observed in gene of that pathway, and the overall mutational frequency of all the genes in that pathway.

Here is a visual representation of that table in bar plot format:

{% include image-modal.html %}

The <span style="color: blue">PlotOncogenicPathways()</span> function allows you to visualize a pathway as an oncoplot:

Use the following command to generate an oncoplot for the RTK-RAS pathway:

<code style="color: blue">PlotOncogenicPathways(maf = tcga_luad_maf, pathways = "RTK-RAS")</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

{% include image-modal.html %}

This plot visualizes the 82 genes that were mutated in almost 500 TCGA-LUAD samples. Tumor suppressor genes are colored in red and oncogenes are colored in blue. The plot orders the genes from top to bottom on the left side from most to least mutated. We can see here that KRAS is the most mutated gene in the RTK-RAS pathway, followed by EGFR and NF1.

**Tip:** If this appears cluttered in your Plot tab in R, click the Zoom button to open the plot in a different window.

We can visualize the TP53 pathway for additional practice, and to see what a less cluttered plot looks like:

<code style="color: blue">PlotOncogenicPathways(maf = tcga_luad_maf, pathways = "TP53")</code>{% include code-snippet-copy.html %}

{% include image-modal.html %}

This plot visualizes the 6 genes that were mutated in over 300 TCGA-LUAD samples. Tumor suppressor genes are colored in red and oncogenes are colored in blue. The plot orders the genes from top to bottom on the left side from most to least mutated. We can see here that *TP53* is the most mutated gene in the TP53 pathway, followed by *ATM* and *CHEK2*.

**Tip:** You can add sample names across the bottom of the plot, using the argument <span style="color: blue">showTumorSampleBarcodes = TRUE</span>. You can also include genes that are in the selected pathway but were not mutated (if applicable), using the argument <span style="color: blue">fullPathway = TRUE</span>.

For additional practice, we can save this plot to our current working directory. In the Plots window, you can select Export, and then Save as Image or Save as PDF:
