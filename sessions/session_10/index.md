### Topics Covered
- Experimental design: number of reads, pair end sequencing, benefits (e.g. Cost, inhouse)
- Example of integrating RNA-seq with other molecular data
- Data processing: data format, data QC, alignment, visualization/quantification, issues specific to RNA-seq (splicing)
- Nanostring analysis

## Practical
- RNA-seq: Alignment, assembly, quantification, alternative splicing
