The aim of this session is to provide an in-depth summary of the DNA
sequencing techniques most useful for cancer genomics, particularly
next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Pacbio long read sequencing. First
we will cover the very basics of NGS sequencing including a general
sequencing workflow and considerations when choosing samples for
sequencing. We will also provide an overview of quality control metrics
to ensure your DNA samples are of suitable quality and quantity for
sequencing.

Next, we will look more closely at the various sequencing platforms
available today, specifically their scientific principles and
capabilities. We will follow this section with a more in-depth look at
targeted sequencing panels, whole-exome sequencing (WES), and
whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to highlight practical details and compare
the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. The aim of this section
is to give you a very clear idea of what sequencing method will best fit
your needs for your next genomics study.

Finally we willcover quality control metrics for your sequencing data so you
can be sure your NGS data is suitable for analysis.
