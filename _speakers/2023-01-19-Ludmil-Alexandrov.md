Ludmil Alexandrov is an Associate Professor at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Dr. Alexandrov received his Ph.D. in 2014 from the Wellcome Sanger Institute researching mutational processes and signatures in human cancers. Dr. Alexandrov then went on to research as an Oppenheimer Fellow at the Los Alamos National Laboratory before becoming an Assistant Professor at UCSD in 2018 and an Associate Professor in 2021.

His research on mutational signatures and algorithms for mutational signature decomposition in human cancers has revolutionized mutational signature research and has received numerous awards and recognition: recognition from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (2014), the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center's Harold M. Weintraub Award (2015), Science magazine's Prize for Young Scientists in Genomics and Proteomics (2015), Oxford University Press' Carcinogenesis Young Investigator Award (2016), Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship in Computational & Evolutionary Molecular Biology (2018), the Balfour Prize Lecture of the Genetics Society (2018), The International Academy for Medical and Biological Engineering's Early Career Award (2018), the Packard Foundation's Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering (2019), and the Outstanding New Environmental Scientist Award from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (2020).

Dr. Alexandrov's many publications have been cited 36,858 times as of August 2022. His lab develops and maintains the highly popular [SigProfiler](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/tools/) software suite for mutational signature decomposition, and collaborates with Wellcome Sanger Institute to maintain the [COSMIC Catalogue of mutational signatures](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/).
