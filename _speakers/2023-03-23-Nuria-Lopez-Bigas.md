Núria López-Bigas is an ICREA Research Professor at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine in Barcelona. She is interested in the identification of cancer driver mutations, genes and pathways across tumor types and in understanding the mutational processes leading to the accumulation of mutations in cancer cells.

[Her lab](http://bbglab.irbbarcelona.org) combines strong expertise in biology and bioinformatics. They are the developers of IntOGen.org, a compendium of cancer genes across cancer types, and of [CGI](cancergenomeinterpreter.org), a tool to annotate cancer driver mutations and biomarkers of drug response in individual tumors. Núria López-Bigas was elected member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) in 2016 and Fellow of the International Society of Computational Biology (ISCB) in 2021.
