Dr. Park is a Professor of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School and the director of its PhD program in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics. [His research group](http://compbio.hms.harvard.edu) specializes in computational and statistical analysis of large-scale DNA sequencing data to understand genetic and epigenetic mechanisms related to disease processes.

Originally trained in applied mathematics (B.A., Harvard; Ph.D., Caltech), he was introduced to molecular biology and genetics during his postdoctoral studies in biostatistics. His laboratory has developed a number of algorithms for genome analysis, especially for identification of structural alterations from whole-genome sequencing data. His group has made substantial contributions to consortium projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), and 4D Nucleome (4DN).
