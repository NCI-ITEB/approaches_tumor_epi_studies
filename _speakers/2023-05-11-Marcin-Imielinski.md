Marcin Imieliński MD, PhD, Associate Professor, Weill Cornell Medicine, Core Member, New York Genome Center, is a physician-scientist whose research is focused on understanding patterns of complex, noncoding, and structural genomic variation in human cancer.  As a molecular genetic pathologist, he is also interested in the clinical applications of whole genome sequencing.Prior to joining WCM and NYGC, Marcin Imieliński completed a postdoctoral fellowship with Matthew Meyerson at the Broad Institute, residency and fellowship in molecular pathology at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School,  PhD in genomics and computational biology and MD at the University of Pennsylvania, and B.S. in Computer Science from Rutgers College.

The Imieliński laboratory has recently uncovered three novel classes of complex genomic rearrangements by developing novel genome graph approaches to studying cancer structural variation (Cell 2020).  They have also applied these methods to delineate SV patterns in telomere crisis (Nature Communications 2021) and lung adenocarcinomas that lack known oncogenic drivers (Cell Reports 2021).  Recent work has included the application of long read sequencing to understand cooperativity in high-order 3D genome structure through the development of a new long-read genome-wide proximity ligation assay (Pore-C) and algorithms (Chromunity) (Nature Biotechnology 2022).  Previous work (Cell 2017) provided some of the first evidence to link passenger somatic mutations patterns in human tumors to transcriptional states of cancer cells of origin.  

His laboratory has developed innovative WGS methods for structural variant assembly (SvAbA, Genome Research 2018) and cancer driver analysis (fishHook, Cell 2017). Dr. Imielinski has an h-index of 57, having contributed to over 100 publications that have been cited over 47,000 times.
