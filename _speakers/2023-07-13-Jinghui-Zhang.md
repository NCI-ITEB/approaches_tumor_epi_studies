---

Dr. Jinghui Zhang is the Chair of the Department of Computational Biology and Endowed Chair of Bioinformatics at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Her research is to understand the effect of genetic alterations on cancer. Her major accomplishments include mapping the landscapes of >20 pediatric cancers; development of novel algorithms leading to discoveries of targetable kinase fusions, novel oncogenic fusions, non-coding driver variants; defining germline cancer predisposition mutations in pediatric cancer; implementing an integrated clinical sequencing pipeline; and performing the first pan-pediatric cancer analysis unveiling striking difference in mutational signature and driver gene landscape of pediatric versus adult cancer.

Her lab has discovered the therapy-related mutational signatures in relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, osteosarcoma and most recently, survivors of pediatric cancer. An advocate for genomic data sharing, she has developed the St. Jude Cloud which now hosts multi-omics data generated from >10,000 pediatric cancer patients. Dr. Zhang is a recipient of the 2019 AACR Team Science Award, was recently selected as a Fellow of the International Society of Computational Biology, and is one of the most highly cited scientists in the last decade with a total of >150,000 citations.
