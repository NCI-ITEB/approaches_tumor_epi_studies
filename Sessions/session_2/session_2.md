In this session we will provide an overview of the many public resources
useful for cancer genomics. We will begin by highlighting major public
cancer genomics studies and their associated data portals such as PCAWG,
TCGA, GDC and more, plus general genetics databases useful for any type
of genomic analysis such as Ensembl, 1000 genomes, gnomAD, etc.

Then we will highlight various resources for more in-depth cancer genomics
analysis such as platforms for driver gene analysis, FIREBROWSE, IPA,
several websites for mutational signature analysis, and more. Finally
we’ll conclude the session by highlighting databases with programmatic
access, several cloud-based analysis resources, and the “Awesome
Bioinformatics” resources.
