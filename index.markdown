title: Emerging Approaches for Tumor Analyses in Epidemiological Studies
---

Welcome to the github pages for the "Emerging Approaches for Tumor Analyses in Epidemiological Studies" course! This course is provided by NCI-ITEB, and taught by bioinformaticians from the Sherlock Lung study on lung cancer in never smokers.

## Course Description

#### Aim

This course aims to provide basic information on the types of analyses that can be conducted using tumor specimens to study the etiology and progression of cancer within epidemiological studies. No previous experience on genomics or pathology analyses is required to attend this course; however, some basic knowledge on programming (e.g., R or Linux/Shell) and Next Generation Sequencing would be useful.

#### Structure

The course includes 12 sessions divided into several modules.  Participants are encouraged to attend all sessions but may choose specific sessions based on topics of interest. Participants who attend the entire in-person course will receive a certificate of completion (which can be included in their CVs).  Moreover, the skill sets acquired through the course could enable participants to test their own hypotheses and approaches using Sherlock-Lung data or other genomics data. The results of these analyses may serve as “preliminary data” to apply for NCI/DCEG awards.

Sessions will be held approximately every two weeks.  Most sessions will consist of two 1-hour segments separated by a 15-minute break. The first “lecture” hour will include theoretical explanations of the topic, a 15-minute question and answer period, and a brief introduction of the topic for the next session in two weeks.  The second “practical” hour is optional and is aimed at investigators or fellows that want to learn how to conduct these types of analyses or interpret results.  The practical hour will include hands-on practice for participants to conduct analyses with instructors’ help.  

Sessions will be led by two or three ITEB investigators who will either present the topic of the day or moderate the discussion with teachers invited for the occasion from NIH or other institutions. Several sessions will also include one invited speaker, a senior leader in the field, who will be invited to give a DCEG-wide seminar on the session’s topic, separate from this course. The session moderator will introduce the invited speaker and provide background information to connect the course session with the DCEG-wide seminar. There will be an attempt to coordinate certain topics with the “Molecular Epidemiology Course” and the
GWAS-related course.

#### Resources

<!--A “Slack” channel will be created where course participants can pose questions related to the sessions.--> Questions will be collected and addressed during a one- or two-hour “ask a bioinformatician" follow-up meeting with ITEB teachers, colleagues, and course participants who posed questions. The follow-up meetings will be held once per month and will cover the topics presented in the weeks before.

Learning objectives and materials (including codes, data, questions, instructions, and software checklist) will be uploaded on this website prior to each session. Course slides and links to recordings of the DCEG-wide seminars on related topics will also be posted here for future use. After each session and at the end of the course, participants will be invited to complete a brief evaluation form online to provide feedback to the course organizers and teachers.

We expect that changes to the course plan will be made along the way, based on feedback from participants.
