As a reminder, the first session of the Emerging Approaches for Tumor Analyses in Epidemiological Studies course is this upcoming Wednesday, Nov. 2, at 9:30 AM. The lecture components will be held both virtually and in person at the NCI Shady Grove campus, auditorium TE 406/408/410.

The practical session will begin at 10:45am, and participants in the practical session *must be present in person*. Please remember to bring a laptop with you to the practical, and for Windows users it would be helpful to install PuTTy beforehand, [link here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).
