First of all, thank you to all of the participants yesterday! It was great to see so much interest both virtually and in person, and we hope you all learned a lot!

Next week we will present Session 2: Public Databases. These databases are very useful resources for both analyzing already existing sequencing data to answer research questions without spending a dime, and also for analyzing your own data. The lecture will provide an overview of the many databases at your disposal, and in the practical we will guide you through using some of these databases to answer example research questions.

The location and time remain the same: next Wednesday Nov. 9 at 9:30am in auditorium TE 406/408/410 at NCI Shady Grove. For virtual lecture attendees, you should receive a zoom link in your inbox. If not, contact phuc.hoang@nih.gov.

We hope to see you all then!
