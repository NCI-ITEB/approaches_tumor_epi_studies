Azhar is working on his dissertation research in bioinformatics and systems biology under the supervision of Maria Teresa Landi, M.D., Ph.D., and Ludmil Alexandrov, Ph.D., at the University of California San Diego. He is interested in integrating large-scale omics datasets to ultimately elucidate the biological mechanisms that drive cancer formation and progression, with a particular focus on structural variants, copy number alterations and extrachromosomal DNA.
